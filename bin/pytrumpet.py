# trumpet.py : Play trumpet using your computer through python
# 
# trumpet.py allows you to play a sound font by using your keyboard as valves,
# and your microphone to listen to the sound produced by a mouthpiece. Using
# these two features a note is played using Fluidsynth (via mingus) from a 
# soundfont.
